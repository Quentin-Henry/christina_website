                I see adult individuals and couples, preferably in person but
                also recognize that’s not always possible. I like to say that
                I’m an individual therapist who can hold the complexity of your
                relational world and a couples therapist who recognizes the
                sacred autonomy of the individual. I can help you identify
                habitual patterns, gain awareness of triggers, learn flexibility
                in response to stress, as well as to communicate with partners
                differently, through working with active listening, assertive
                communication and sharpening your language skills.

                Good therapy illuminates what we do and why we do it. It can
                help you be more compassionate about the past, with self and
                others. At the same time, a good therapist pushes you to become
                more accountable in the present. Practice doing one thing
                differently! Learn to say it in a way your partner will hear it.
                On a thought level, therapy moves us toward flexibility and
                integration, recognizing that in most relationships there’s a
                lot of gray area–many things can be true at once in a
                relationship. Good therapy should work not just on change but on
                accepting what is. To accept yourself or the reality of your
                situation does not mean it will never change or that you
                shouldn’t try to improve but that you stop energetically running
                away from where you are right now. We need to explore the
                mysteries of the past, be accountable in the present and to
                loosen our grip on the illusion of a predefined future.

                Many of my clients are creatives and if you're looking for a
                programmatic way of working, like a short term CBT model, I'm
                not the right fit. But I also think clients should be wary of a
                process that's only gentle and accommodating. Therapy is not
                meant to be a warm bath– it's best to speak together openly and
                frankly.

                If you’re going to come in and do the work, it should be weekly
                at first and should be focused. Couples benefit from couples
                therapy because it’s a place where they can learn to have a
                different conversation with each other and to re-establish
                kindness and empathy. For individuals, I’ll want to know your
                goals and expectations for therapy, recognizing that for so many
                New Yorkers what’s most helpful involves a growth
                mandate(support for a meditation practice, accountability around
                health habits, workplace communication strategies, how to reduce
                conflict in your romantic relationship).Ultimately, therapy is
                an important investment in personal and relational growth– it
                helps people grow up, function more effectively in the world and
                treat self and others with more empathy. When you work it, it
                works. I can help.

                    I'm a systems thinker. I understand people through the lens
                    of their relationships, past and present. From my original
                    training in family systems theory and my early work in
                    hospice bereavement service, suicide prevention and other
                    crisis modalities, I've ranged broadly in my own
                    explorations of personal meaning and how it's imaginally
                    constituted. In crisis and bereavement work I learned the
                    power of witness, to sit with people without trying to "fix"
                    the pain of a tragic experience. That was terrific training
                    in talking, listening and staying close to what's true.
                    Since then, I've spent 15 years as a couples and individual
                    therapist in private practice. I'm a longtime member of a
                    professional supervision group run by Esther Perel, LMFT and
                    her thinking has been tremendously impactful in my outlook
                    and work with couples. I've served as the Clinical Director
                    for two different Marriage and Family training practices,
                    providing clinical supervision and running the training
                    program for dozens of post masters trainees. I have advanced
                    training in various modalities, including extensive training
                    in RLT(Relational Life Therapy), Prepare/Enrich, Discernment
                    Counseling and Critical Incident Stress Debriefing. I have a
                    working knowledge of Imago and The Gottman Method and use
                    many of those techniques. But beyond my professional
                    background, my own passions and life experience come into
                    the room a lot. Parenthood, an informal and extroverted
                    style, my past as a poet and professor of literature– as
                    well as film, rock music and visual art–have been deeply
                    influential in my thinking as a therapist. The thing that
                    art and relational psychotherapy has in common is the
                    compassionate awareness that we are not alone. In my work
                    with clients, I make space for the philosophical, the
                    intuitive and their intersection: the things we know without
                    reason.

                As a younger therapist, I cared deeply about personal stories
                but didn't understand the way in which workplace relationships
                are often part of that personal story. I saw work issues as a
                passing reflection of whatever workplace culture in which that
                particular person happened to find herself, not yet
                understanding workplaces as predictable sites of co-created,
                dynamic systems, in which team members often take on roles
                familiar in other parts of their life. With my foundational
                training in family systems, I began to notice the ways in which
                my client’s workplaces were organized in similar ways to their
                families. Struggles with authority, “sibling” rivalry,
                difficulty in communicating effectively, people pleasing, fear
                of confrontation, etc–were endemic in workplace relational
                structures. I began to talk with my clients about looking at
                their relational and attachment styles, not just in terms of how
                they were showing up in their romantic and platonic
                relationships—but how they were interacting at work, too. Both
                families and workplaces operate as homeostatic systems. Within
                those systems, individuals often play roles(both official
                assigned roles within the workplace hierarchy and also shadow
                roles–caretaker, martyr, angry person–in which legitimate
                authority and overt hierarchy are mediated or even eclipsed by
                covert dynamics that don’t correspond to the org chart.

                Patrick Lencioni, in his seminal book of the same name, defines
                the five dysfunctions of a team: absence of trust, fear of
                conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability and
                inattention to results. Consultants often come into an
                organization to evaluate the last three of these items but, in
                my estimation, often insufficiently address the first two items.
                Conflict avoidance and lack of trust on a team are not solely
                linked to organizational style, structure or decision making.
                Leadership isn't always able to “organize” themselves out of a
                trust problem, for example. It’s important to look at
                individuals on a team and the collective team dynamic: their
                orientation to vulnerability, trusting authority and their
                baseline conflict resolution skills. In looking at Lencioni’s
                first two items, it’s apparent that professionals with a
                background in mental health and wellness, systemic thinking and
                relational intelligence are needed to help leaders address the
                interpersonal aspects of team functioning.
              </p>
              <p>
                My consultation work within workplace settings involves teaching
                team members about emotional self regulation, appropriate
                vulnerability, structural issues that support emotional safety
                in the workplace(understood policies and procedures that have
                been communicated ahead of a problem), the language of
                accountability, communication skills(finding the language) and
                acknowledging existing hierarchies and power structures, both
                explicit and implicit power structures. For leaders, training
                and practice are needed– the ability to pull the camera back and
                see the larger picture within a given workplace conflict.
              </p>
              <p>
                I rely heavily upon my seminal training in family and group
                systems, particularly the work of Irvin Yalom, Carl Whitaker,
                Salvador Minuchin, The Milan and Palo Alto groups of Family
                Therapists and Virginia Satir. In organizational consulting,
                I've been influenced by the Competing Values Framework in
                looking at styles and solutions within workplace culture and
                Brene Brown, Patrick Lencioni and Simon Sinek for their work on
                vulnerability, change and servant leadership. My thinking has
                also been influenced by models for change management, such as
                the Kubler Ross Change Curve and the Satir Change Model.
